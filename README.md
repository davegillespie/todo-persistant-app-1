# TODO App 

You will need to set up your own Airtable TODO table, find the API_KEY and BASE_ID. 

You must write the get and post.

## Bonus

Instead of logging out the results from the `$.get`, add them to the #list-items in the html with the following markup:

```html
<div class="list-item">
    <strong>Name:</strong>
    <strong>Notes:</strong>
    <strong>Done?:</strong>
</div>
```

Additionally, add an item after the `$.post` succeeds to the HTML.
